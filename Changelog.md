### v3.0.0

[2020.07.20; Maikuolan] First stable release for the phpMussel v3 CLI handler.

__*Why "v3.0.0" instead of "v1.0.0?"*__ Prior to phpMussel v3, the "phpMussel Core", "phpMussel CLI-mode", "phpMussel Front-End", and "phpMussel Uploads Handler" ("phpMussel Web") were all bundled together as a single repository (phpMussel/phpMussel). Since phpMussel v3, these each all have their own, separate repositories. I've opted to start releases at this repository (phpMussel/CLI) at *v3.0.0*, in order to avoid confusion with previous versions of the "phpMussel CLI-mode" which exist outside this repository.

### v3.1.0

[2020.12.04; Maikuolan]: Maintenance release (dependencies update, repository cleanup, etc).

### v3.1.1

[2021.01.10; Maikuolan]: Separated the code for performing outbound requests through cURL out to its own independent class.
